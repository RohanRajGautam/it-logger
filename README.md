# IT-Logger

> The idea of  the project is that, it's an internal app for an IT-department, within the organization where people can add **logs** regarding problems that occur and are fixed within the system, also they can add technicians, search logs etc. 

> I've used redux for this project, redux is a 3rd party **state manager** used usually for large scale applications.(combining reducers etc.)

> The main purpose of this application was to learn using redux for managing state within the application.(bye-bye Context),however the idea is still the same **App level state**
